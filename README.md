Maths Engine

Welcome! Maths Engine is a C# project where I’m building a collection of tools to handle GCSE and Further Maths topics. 
It’s still an early prototype, but it already performs some useful calculations and is growing fast.

Features:
-	Easy-to-use maths functions
-	Organised into clear topic areas
-	Built with clean OOP design
-	Designed to expand over time

Current Modules:
- Statistics:
  -	Spearman’s Rank / Bivariate analysis
  -	Standard Deviation
  -	Mean, Median, Mode etc.
- Pure Maths:
  -	Pythagoras Theorem

Planned Features
Coming as I develop the project further:
-	More statistical measures
-	Algebra tools
-	Differentiation and integration
-	Mechanics topics
-	Graphing support in a GUI
-	Step-by-step explanations
-	Unit testing
-	Optional SQL database support
