Maths Engine

Welcome! Maths Engine is a C# project where I’m building a collection of tools to handle GCSE and Further Maths topics. 
It’s still an early prototype, but it already performs some useful calculations and is growing fast.

Features:
-	Easy-to-use maths functions
-	Organised into clear topic areas
-	Built with clean OOP design
-	Designed to expand over time

Current Modules:
- Statistics:
  -	Spearman’s Rank / Bivariate analysis
  -	Standard Deviation
  -	Mean, Median, Mode etc.
- Pure Maths:
  -	Pythagoras Theorem
  -	Matrices
- Mechanics:
  - UVATS Equations
  - Newton's Laws Calculations 

## Documentation

📖 **[Code Review and Future Development Roadmap](CODE_REVIEW_AND_ROADMAP.md)**

A comprehensive analysis of the codebase including:
- Detailed code review findings (critical bugs, quality issues, build warnings)
- Strategic roadmap for WPF, async/await, generics, and delegates implementation
- Database integration planning
- Expanded mathematical features roadmap
- Code examples and best practices

Planned Features
Coming as I develop the project further:
-	More statistical measures
-	Mechanics topics
-	Graphing support in a GUI
-	Step-by-step explanations
-	Unit testing

Folder Structure
The project is organized into two main folders: `Core` for the user interface and menu system, and `Modules` for the calculation logic.
