# Bivariate Analysis

## Purpose

This module provides tools to calculate the correlation between two sets of data.

## Key Components

*   **`BivariateAnalyisis.cs`**: The main entry point for the Bivariate Analysis feature.
*   **`BivariateAnalysisLogic.cs`**: Contains the core calculation logic, keeping it separate from the user interaction.
*   **`Variables.cs`**: A static class that holds the data and results for the calculations.
*   **`Correlation.cs`**: An enum that displays the string value of the correlation.

## How to Use

```csharp
// Example of how to calculate standard deviation
StandardDeviation.Calculate();
```

## Dependencies

Mention if this module relies on any other modules in your project.
*Example*: "This module depends on `MathsEngine.Modules.Core.StatisticsHelpers` for basic calculations like mean and median."
