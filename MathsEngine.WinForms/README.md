# MathsEngine.WinForms

This is a Windows Forms application stub for the Maths Engine.

## Status

This project is a placeholder for future Windows Forms UI development. Currently, only the CLI version is fully implemented.

## Building

This project requires Windows to build and run. To build on Windows:

```bash
dotnet build MathsEngine.WinForms.csproj
```

## Future Development

The WinForms UI can use the same MathsEngine.Core library that the CLI version uses, providing:
- Pythagoras Theorem calculations
- Trigonometry calculations
- Matrix operations
- Statistics calculations
- Mechanics calculations

All core calculation logic is available in the MathsEngine.Core project and can be integrated into forms-based UI.
